Gohar Khan

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, with a passion for technology that can help create a better society. I've taken the CS50 course from Harvard and Python courses from Ideo, which have helped me build a strong foundation in programming. My expertise lies in C#, but I also enjoy working with Python, C, and SQL.

I’m passionate about backend web development and AI/ML, and have recently started contributing to open-source projects to expand my skillset and give back to the tech community.

When I’m not coding, I love learning new things, gaming, and exploring different languages. I’m always looking to connect with others and learn from new challenges.
